# Navigation and Radar Services

# Description
---
Describe Navigation services most common and available to pilots (aside from pilotage). Describe Radar services used by ATC as well as a light discussion on airborne Radar

# Objectives
---
Student will understand the different, common navigation services available to them as well as radar services provided by ATC as well as airborne radar

## Elements
---
* Navigation options:
    - VOR/VORTAC, DME, NDB, GPS
* VOR/VORTAC
    * VHF Omnidirectional Range
    * VORTAC is a VOR with a Military TACAN co-located
    * TACAN has a VOR component but also the ground based portion of DME
    * High Low and Terminal VORS
* Finding a VOR/VORTAC on the charts
* Tuning and Identifying a VOR
    * Talking via a VOR with FSS
* Navigating via a VOR
    * OBS and CDI
    * To and From plus flag
    * Heading not relevant
    * Zone of confusion
* DME - measures slant-range distance. No need to tune
* NDB - 190 kHz - 1750 kHs
    * Being reduced over time due to GPS
* GPS
    * Consists of 31 satellites in orbit
    * Need three for position, four for altitude (though alt is not perfect)
    * RAIM uses 24
    * Provides exact time and location (lat/long) within 3/4 meters
    * Can also provide groundspeed
* Radar Services
    * Ground based position radar
        * Used Enroute, and in terminal operations
        * Primary RADAR will show airplane but drops rapidly over distance
        * Secondary radar interrogates the airplane transponder to get location, speed and (Mode C) altitude
            * Mode S used in TCAS systems. Can interrogate Transponders nearby
    * ADSB - Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast
    * Weather radar
        * Used to get reflections off of visible moisture
            * Rain/snow
    * Airborne Radar
        * Used to detect moisture not other airplanes. Same principle for visible moisture
