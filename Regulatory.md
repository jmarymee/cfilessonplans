# 14 CFR and Publications
## Description
---
14 CFR relevant areas plus related publications and where to find them

## Objective
---
Describe at a high level the various parts of CFR and related publications that a student must know in order to be an effective pilot

## Elements
---
* Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14 (no longer referred to as FARs)
    * Divided into multiple parts based on area of impact:
    * 14 CFR Part 1: **Definitions and abbreviations**
    * 14 CFR Part 61: **CERTIFICATION: PILOTS, FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS, AND GROUND INSTRUCTORS**
    * 14 CFR 91: **General operating and flight rules**
* Advisory Circulars
    * **A type of publication by the FAA to provide guidance for compliance with Airworthiness, pilot certification, operational standards, training standards, and any other rules within the 14 CFR Aeronautics and Space Title**
    * They define acceptable means, but not the only means, of accomplishing or showing compliance with airworthiness regulations
    * Generally informative in nature, Advisory Circulars are neither binding nor regulatory
    * Some have the effect of de facto standards or regulations
* NTSB 830 (National Transportation and Safety Board)
    * They are responsible for civil transportation accident investigation
    * Several areas where pilots must be aware:
        * **Initial notification of aircraft incidents, accidents and overdue aircraft**
        * **Preservation of aircraft wreckage, mail, cargo and records**
        * **Reporting of aircraft accidents, incidents, and overdue aircraft**
* Practical Test Standards and Airmen Certification Standards
    * **The ACS is an enhanced version of the PTS, and it began replacing the PTS on June 15, 2016. The ACS adds task-specific knowledge and risk management elements to each PTS Area of Operation/Task. The result is an integrated presentation of specific knowledge, risk management, and skill elements for each task**
    * Private and Commercial standards are now ACS based
    * Flight Instructor, Instrument and many others are still PTS based
* Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) and Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)
    * A typical AFM is a pilot's operating handbook (POH), which became the standard format for an AFM after 1978. An aircraft flight manual is serial number specific, whereas a pilot's operating handbook is merely model specific
