# Lazy Eights
## Description
---
A Maneuver that is basically two 180 degree turns in opposite directions, with each turn including a climb and a descent

## Objective
---
To develop the smoothness, coordination, orientation, planning, division of attention, and ability to maintain precise aircraft control.

## Elements
---
* **Clear the area**
* **Choose forced landing area**
* **Configure the aircraft**
    * Straight and level, V/A or 90 KTS for C-172. Power set, trim for hands off
* **Select outside reference** (***45, 90, and 135 degree points***)
* **Gradual climbing turn towards 45 degree point, increasing pitch and bank** so that at 45 degree point you are highest pitch and 15 degrees of bank (***tip: adjust pitch before bank. pitch, pitch, pitch, bank***)
* **From 45 degrees to 90 degrees decrease pitch to horizon while increasing your bank nd maintain coordinated flight so that at 90 degrees you are level with maximum altitude, approximately 30 degrees of bank and slowest airspeed**, all while gradually reducing elevator back pressure
* **From 90 degrees to 135 degrees slowly roll out bank while gradually lowering the nose so that upon reaching 135 degrees the nose is at the lowest pitch** approximately equal but opposite of the the highest achieved earlier, with bank angle of 15 degrees, all the while relaxing rudder and aileron pressure
* **Arrive at the 180 degree point straight-and-level** at the original heading, altitude and airspeed
* **Maintain ball centered**
* **Look for traffic**
* **Continue the maneuver in the opposite direction**

## Practical Test Standards
---
* Exhibits knowledge of the elements related to lazy eights
* Selects an altitude that will allow the task to be performed no lower than 1500 AGL
* Establishes the recommended entry configuration, power, and airspeed
* Maintains coordinated flight throughout the maneuver
* Achieves the following throughout the maneuver:
    * Approximately 30 degrees at the steepest point
    * Constant change of pitch and roll rate
    * Altitude tolerance and 180 degree points, +/-100' from entry altitude
    * Airspeed tolerance at the 180 degree point +/-10 KTS
    * Heading tolerance at the 180 degree point +/-10 degrees
* Continues maneuver through the number of symmetrical loops specified and resumes straight and level flight

## Common Errors
---
* Failure to clear the area
* Using the nose or engine cowling instead of the true longitudinal axis, resulting in unsymmetrical loops
* Watching the airplane instead of the reference points
* Control roughness, usually caused by attempts to counteract poor planning
* Persistent gain or loss of altitude with the completion of each eight
* Attempting to perform the maneuver rhythmically, resulting in poor pattern symmetry
* Allowing the airplane to fall out of the tops of the loops rather than flying the airplane through the maneuver
* Slipping and/or skidding
* Failure to scan for traffic during the maneuver
