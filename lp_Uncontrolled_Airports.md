# Uncontrolled Airports

## Description
---
Describe operating around an uncontrolled airport in contrast to a towered airport

## Time
00:20 minutes

## Objectives
---
Describe at a high level how to identify an uncontrolled airport, how to taxi, depart, arrive and self-manage traffic flows as a pilot flying into an uncontrolled airport

## Elements
---
* Identifying an uncontrolled airport on a chart
    * Bonus: Lack of class D does not mean it's uncontrolled!
* Determining traffic patterns for airport runway(s)
    * Overfly at 500' above TPA (normally 1500' AGL)
* Communications:
    * CTAF - UNICOM, MULTICOM (122.9), FSS
    * Inbound - 10 miles in for announcement of intentions
    * Outbound - monitor until 10 miles out of area
    * FSS - May provide Airport Advisory Service
* Determining weather, NOTAMS, Runway lengths, frequencies
    * Weather Reporting
        * AWOS - Automated Weather Observing System (FAA)
            - Surface winds are TRUE
        * ASOS - Automated Surface Observing System (NWS)
            - Surface winds are converted to Magnetic
            - Additional capabilities over AWOS of reporting temperature and dew point in degrees Fahrenheit, present weather, icing, lightning, sea level pressure and precipitation accumulation
