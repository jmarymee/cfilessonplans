# First Dual XC 
Taught by Craig van Generen in Regal ground school

## Where do you want to fly
Must be > 50nm top count for logged XC time
Let a student pick a place where they want to fly to and then plan a flight. Perhap choose a dog leg so that winds and heading will be different

First Entry in NavLog
    Origin Airport

Then enter TOC into Navlog as second entry

Choose Altitude
    East versus West plus obstale clearance

Then the next checkpoint

Then TOD Top of descent

Then Final Destination

Next determine course lines using protractor
    For each directional leg

Get Winds - rule of thumb approxmation using NMS or Foreflight
    Just pick one don't need to do full interpolation

Get TOC info
    use Pressure altitude as aproximation

Determine TOC waypoint

Next add fuel to NavLog. Use Taxi/Takeoff/Fuel used to TOC

Next determine cruise info. 
    Eyeball KTS + RPM + Fuel
        Don't need to interpolate

TOD - Top of Descent
    Get Destination Airport Altitude
        Use 500 FPM 
            Determine descent point based on cruise speed and 500 FPM

Next get leg distances

Next Calculate Winds
    Get WCA and GS

Next calculate True Heading (WCA +/- True Course)

Next calculate Magnetic Heading (Variance +/- True Heading)

Next Calculate Compass Heading (MH +/- compass deviation)

Now we have distance and speed so we can now calc time (ETE)
    Use E6B

Next Fuel burn and how much used
    Set E6B  triangle to GPH inside time, outside get fuel burned

Next Get fual totals

Calc Total ETE

Calc Total Distance

Next we can now fill out the flight plan

Next detail procedure for VFR flight plan filing

[NO RUNWAY LENGTHS / W&B / TAKEOFF and LANDING unless a specific need to on flight one]
