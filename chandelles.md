# Chandelle
## Description
---
A maximum performance 180 degree climbing turn
## Objective
---
To teach planning, orientation, division of attention and control feel for maximum performance flight.
## Elements
---
* Clear the area
* Choose forced landing area
* Configure the aircraft for maneuvering
    * V/A or less. Typically 90 kts on C172
    * Flaps up, Gear up, power set for level flight at appx 90 kts
* Select outside reference (off of wingtip 90 degrees where first turn will ideally be into the wind)
* Establish a coordinated 30 degree banked turn
* Throttle to FULL
* Apply pitch. Plan to arrive at 90 degree point at maximum pitch
* Anticipate and apply rudder as necessary
* **Maintain pitch attitude** once at 90 degree with increasing back elevator pressure while reducing bank to 180 degree point
    * as aircraft slows, greater back elevator is required to maintain pitch
* **At 180 degree point, roll wings level**, (90 degree point is now off opposite wing from the start), slightly above stall speed
    * Rolling out of a LEFT chandelle requires MORE right rudder 
    * Rolling out of a RIGHT chandelle requires little rudder pressure but will require right rudder pressure to maintain heading upon completion of the rollout
* Gently reduce pitch to straight and level but maintain altitude and build airspeed
* Adjust throttle to  maintain altitude
* Maintain ball centered
* Look for traffic

***Easy way to remember the maneuver’s basics: “Bank and Yank”***

## Practical Test Standards
---
* Exhibits knowledge of the elements related to Chandelles
* Selects and altitude that will allow the maneuver to be performed no lower than 1500' AGL
* Establishes the recommended entry configuration, power and airspeed
* Establishes  the angle of bank at approximately 30 degrees
* Simultaneously power and pitch to maintain a smooth, coordinated climbing turn to the 90 degree point, with constant bank
* Begins a coordinated constant rate rollout from the 90 degree point to the 180 degree point maintaining power and a constant pitch attitude
* Completes rollout at the 180 degree point, +/- 10 degree just above stall speed and maintaining that airspeed momentarily avoiding a stall
* Resumes straight and level flight with minimum loss of altitude

## Common Errors
---
* Failure to adequately clear the area
* Too shallow of an initial bank resulting in a stall
* Too steep of an initial bank resulting in failure to gain maximum performance
* Allowing the actual bank to increase after establishing initial bank angle
* Failure to start recovery at the 90 degree point in the turn
* Allowing the pitch attitude to increase as the bank is rolled out during the second 90 degree of the turn
* Removing all of the bank before the 180 degree point is reached
* Nose low on recovery resulting in too much airspeed
* Control roughness
* Poor coordination (slipping or skidding)
* Stalling at any point in the maneuver
* Execution of a steep turn instead of a climbing maneuver
* Failure to scan for other aircraft
* Attempting to perform the maneuver by instrument reference rather than visual reference
