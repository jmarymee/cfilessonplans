| 1st class under 40 | 12 months
| 2nd class any age | 12 months
| 3rd class 40 or over | 24 months
| 3rd class under 40 | 60 months

    Higher classes can be used to fulfill the requirements of lower classes
    Check rides can be executed with a lower class medical than the rating sought
    Case in point: Taking a commercial check ride with a valid 3rd class medical or a second class that has fallen to third

### Accommodating Medical Deficiencies and disqualifying conditions
    At the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) may be granted, instead of an Authorization, to a person whose disqualifying condition is static or non-progressive and who has been found capable of performing airman duties without endangering public safety

    A student can still apply with supporting documentation under 14 CFR 67.401

### **Aeromedical physiology: (Chapter 8 of the AIM)**
* Hypoxia
* Ear block
* Sinus Block
* Decompression sickness
* Hyperventilation
* Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
* Disorientation

### **Currency Requirements**

    **Currency requirements:** (14 CFR 61.57) 3 takeoff’s and landings every 90 days for daytime, 3 full-stop takeoff’s and landings every 90 days for nighttime to fly with passengers. Also, a biennial flight review (14 CFR 61.56) consisting of 1 hour of ground that at least covers 14 CFR 91 and 1 hour of flight maneuvers as deemed adequate by the instructor. The pilot certificate (other than student certificate) lasts indefinitely (14 CFR 61.19). Moving requires an update sent to the FAA within 30 days (14 CFR 61.60).

### **Logbook Requirements**

    (14 CFR 61.51) only requirement is training and experience required to obtain certificates, ratings, a flight review, or currency requirements. Expand on how to log time and what to log.
